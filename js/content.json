                graphic designer with over a year in the respective 
                fields. I have built a handful of websites and web 
                applications, and I have a JavaScript library 
                in the works. I've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                Java, and C# in various situations. I also have 
                over 3 years of experience with computer 
                technology, troubleshooting, and networking."

            applications, and design games ever since I discovered 
            there were instructions people wrote to make 
            everything (for the most part) run behind the 
            scenes. I've loved everything that had to do 
            with computers, machine learning, simulations,
            and the Internet for quite a long time. My 
            grandpa and I used to spend days working on 
            numerous construction project throughout my 
            10 years living with him, but since I've moved
            we have, for the most part, lost that connection 
            and chances to do things like we used to. I took
            up coding, for the most part, because it gave me 
            that satisfaction of when him and I would work on
            projects, just without the nails."
